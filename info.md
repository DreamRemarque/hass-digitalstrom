# digitalSTROM component for Home Assistant

This integration makes digitalSTROM lights, covers, switches and scenes available in Home Assistant.

It supports config flows so that you can easily add your digitalSTROM server from the Home Assistant frontend (Configuration -> Integrations).

However it does not support YAML config setup (anymore). The future is the frontend!
